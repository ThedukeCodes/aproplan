 (as I do not code everyday I want to use my projects as pilots for future bigger project this is why I also incluse a lesson summary in my code. This allows me to be up and running with something just by having a look at my project once. Eg: I did not work with Bootsrap in 6 months, I look at this project and I am ready to go)

FIRS STEP "The Viewport":

Every screen (laptop, desktop, smatphone) has a different size counted in Pixel which is the viewport.

There is the hardware pixels and Device Independent Pixels (DIP's). When not meta viewport is set (see code in the <head>) it assumes viewport is at 980 DIP's.

The Device Pixel Ratio (DPR)= ratio to go from hardware pixel to DIP's. Pixel I will use un my CSS are DIP's as long as I set this ratio to 1 accordingly in "initial scale=1".

<USE CASE 1: Images width>

Issue of horizontal scrolling with an image: to avoid people to scroll horizontally on mobile, I should rather use relative width to 100% for all my images. This is why I add a catch all code to my CSS to make sure my images, video and embedded elements will never exceed the full width of any device, to be "safe". 
img, embed, object, video{ maw-width: 100;}

EXCEPTION: 
The logo (as it is the case for this project) does not required a relative width of 100% maximum since it is significantly smaller than the viewport of any device.

<USE CASE 2: Button>

Button should have a minimum of 48px width (min-width:48px; min-height:48px) so I am sure no matter how small the device my buttons will big enough.

You should always work using a mobile first approach, it will help me to 1) prioritize content 2) think about performance (loading and how much data I send to the server).

SECOND STEP "Media Queries":

Media queries will define breaking point and let us specify some style for a specific width and height (eg: smartphone, tablet, desktop). With media queries I can not only style general elements such as the font size or the background but also the layout of the page such as switching from a 3 columns layout on Desktop to a one column layout on Mobile:

@media only screen and (min-device-width : 320px) and (max-device-width : 480px) {

}

I can customize this layout using Flexbox and other grid patterns. (See common responsive patterns)


Bootsrap already adapts his grid system to screen sizes though. So we are cover here

Tables are also quite special rules that may apply on and can be optimized to the responsiveness. (See optimization)

THIRD STEP: IMAGES

- Tips from the reviewer set up the class of the imagte to class="img-responsive";
- Summary of responsive images to come here below:
